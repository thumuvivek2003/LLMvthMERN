Andhra Pradesh is an Indian state renowned as the "Rice Bowl of India" for its agriculture, with a history stretching back to the Vedic period. The state is also known for its rich cultural heritage, ancient temples, and the country's second-longest coastline. 
History and formation
Andhra State was the first state in India to be formed on a linguistic basis, separating the Telugu-speaking regions from the Madras Presidency on October 1, 1953.
The state was formed following the fast-unto-death of activist Potti Sriramulu, whose sacrifice led to a widespread movement for a separate state for Telugu-speaking people.
Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking areas of Hyderabad State in 1956 to create Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, the state was bifurcated again to create the new state of Telangana.
Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh, while Visakhapatnam is the largest city.
